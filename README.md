# VuforiaWire


VuforiaWire is an Augmented Reality game made with Vuforia using Unity3D. The game is a great example of how multiple image targets can be used and their respective augmentations can interact with each other. This is just a demo, feel free to build on this.

The assets used in the game were created by me in Blender. Textures used were downloaded from Poliigon

The final build is present in the 'Builds' folder. To play the game, you'll need the the imagetargets used, which are present in the 'TargetImages' folder
